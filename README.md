# World Cup 2022 Website Project

##### Capstone Project - Build a Complete Website on my Web Development Bootcamp Course with Hyperiondev.com

In this project we had to take a website of a hobby or interest that we had to build for a previous capstone project and add some JavaScript functionality to it.

This was an important milestone in the Bootcamp as I got the opportunity to use a lot of the skills learned throughout the Bootcamp and put everything together.

## Save for Later Feature <a name="saveforlater"></a>
For this feature I had to create a feature where the user could click on a button and save for later. This could be a section of code (like a card) or an image.

The saved for later item would then be stored in local storage and when added the user would get notified of how many items had been added.

If the user had already saved the item then they will get notified to make them aware of this and with this I added the functionality to stop any duplicates being added.

I also created a saved for later webpage to display all the saved items for the user to view.

## Comments Feature <a name="comments"></a>
This feature was to allow the users to add comments on the teams page.

I added some simple form validation which notifies the user of any input errors on the form before allowing the form to submit.

Any comments added where also added to local storage so are still present on page reload and if the user comes back to the page at a later time.

## Like Feature <a name="like"></a>
This feature was to allow the user to like an item on the page, again this was saved to local storage.

Once the item is liked then the styling changes on the button and the wording in the button title to let the user know that the item has already been liked.

If the user clicks on the item for a second time, it will un like the item and change the styling and wording back to the initial state.

## Contact Form Feature <a name="contactform"></a>
The contact form feature allows the user to submit an enquiry, again I applied some simple form validation that will alert the user to fill out any required fields before allowing the form to be submitted.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
As this project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the repository or cloned it, to prevent any CORS errors then I would suggest using something like Live Server in VS Code or something similar.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Below are some screenshots of the features
